## Reproducible Research Project for Predicting Forest Fires.

Binder Link:

This is a project attempting to predict forest fires in a reproducible manner. The data is of two regions of Algeria, namely the Bejaia region located in the northeast of Algeria and the Sidi Bel-abbes region located in the northwest of Algeria. The time period is from June 2012 to September 2012.

Attribute Information:

1. Date : (DD/MM/YYYY) Day, month ('june' to 'september'), year (2012) Weather data observations
2. Temp : temperature noon (temperature max) in Celsius degrees: 22 to 42
3. RH : Relative Humidity in %: 21 to 90
4. Ws :Wind speed in km/h: 6 to 29
5. Rain: total day in mm: 0 to 16.8 FWI Components
6. Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC) index from the FWI system: 28.6 to 92.5
7. Duff Moisture Code (DMC) index from the FWI system: 1.1 to 65.9
8. Drought Code (DC) index from the FWI system: 7 to 220.4
9. Initial Spread Index (ISI) index from the FWI system: 0 to 18.5
10. Buildup Index (BUI) index from the FWI system: 1.1 to 68
11. Fire Weather Index (FWI) Index: 0 to 31.1
12. Classes: two classes, namely fire and not fire.
